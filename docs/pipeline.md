# Pipeline

Read this when a PR check, a push to `main`, or a `v*` tag fails — or before
pushing/tagging if you want to know what's about to run.

## Three triggers, three jobs

- **Pull request** runs PR checks: docker build → **Trivy image scan gate**
  → **Trivy IaC scan gate** → `terraform fmt`/`validate`. **Zero cloud
  credentials** — OIDC trust covers only `refs/heads/main` and
  `refs/tags/v*`, deliberately excluding PR refs, so unmerged code never
  holds credentials. That's why there's no `terraform plan` preview on PRs:
  plan needs a role to assume, and PRs don't get one, on purpose.
- **Push to `main`** builds, scans, and pushes to the app's dev ECR
  repository, then `terraform plan`/`apply`s to **dev**:
  `https://<name>-dev.fd.robertpuffe.com`.
- **Tag `v*`** promotes to **prod**: `https://<name>.fd.robertpuffe.com`.
  Promotion does not rebuild or re-scan — it copies the already-scanned OCI
  manifest for the tagged commit from the dev ECR repository into the prod
  repository, verifies the two digests match, and applies that exact image.
  Separate repositories let dev and prod retain images independently; dev
  churn cannot delete the image a sleeping prod service needs to restart.

Both scan gates fail on HIGH/CRITICAL findings only — a deliberate,
documented threshold, not every low-severity finding.

## Promotion only works on a commit that reached `main`

A tag promotes an image, not source — there is nothing to build at tag
time. So the commit you tag must already have gone through a `main` push
(which is what puts its image in ECR). Tag a commit that was never pushed
to `main` — a branch tip, a squashed/rebased commit with a different SHA,
anything main hasn't built — and promotion fails fast with:

```
no image for commit <sha> — promotion deploys the image main already
built and validated in dev; tag a commit that has been pushed to main
```

Fix: push the commit to `main` first (let dev build and deploy it), then
tag that same SHA.

## Failure → fix playbook

- **Image gate fails** (on a PR or on `main`): almost always stale OS
  packages in the base image, or CVEs bundled inside a package manager the
  app doesn't use at runtime. Fix per `docs/dockerfile.md`: `apk
  upgrade`/`apt-get upgrade`, and strip unused package managers. Confirm
  locally with `trivy image --severity HIGH,CRITICAL <tag>` before
  repushing.
- **IaC gate fails inside the platform's own `fargate-service` module**:
  expected, not your bug. The scan follows Terraform module sources, so it
  reaches into the platform module by design; any accepted findings there
  are already reviewed and documented inline in the module. Nothing to fix
  in your app repo.
- **`terraform apply` fails** (dev on push, prod on tag): read the actual
  error with `gh run view --log-failed` (it shows only the failing step's
  log). Most causes are manifest values the schema should already have
  caught — if `make preflight` passed but apply still fails for a
  schema-shaped reason, that's a platform bug, not something to work
  around.
- **A task stops with `ResourceInitializationError` mentioning SSM or secret
  retrieval**: the manifest declares a secret whose environment parameter is
  missing or unreadable. Run `make secret-check
  MANIFEST=../<app>/app-manifest.yaml ENV=<dev|prod> NAME=<NAME>` as the
  operator. If it is missing, use `secret-set`; if it exists, verify bootstrap
  was reapplied after the managed-secrets platform release. Never paste the
  value into logs, GitHub, Terraform, or the manifest.
- **Promotion fails with "no image for commit"**: the tag points at a
  commit `main` never built. See the promotion rule above — push to `main`
  first, then tag that SHA.
- **Health checks flap right after apply**: normal, in either environment.
  Give newly deployed tasks about **2 minutes** to stabilize and pass their
  target-group health check before the platform reports steady state.
  Don't panic-redeploy inside that window.
- **Healthcheck times out in `make preflight` but the app "works" when you
  poke it manually**: you made boot or the healthcheck depend on
  `storage: s3`. `make preflight` / `make run` have no AWS — `STORAGE_BUCKET`
  is unset locally, same as any environment where storage isn't reachable.
  The healthcheck must pass without it; degrade to memory (`docs/contract.md`,
  Storage section).

## Upgrading the platform version

The template at any given tag pins itself: `main.tf` in a `vX.Y.Z` checkout
references the `fargate-service` module at `ref=vX.Y.Z`, and the contract
files (this doc included) are the ones that shipped with that tag. So
refreshing to a newer (or older) platform release is one operation —
`make upgrade` — not two: it replaces every platform-owned file (`AGENTS.md`,
`CLAUDE.md`, `docs/`, `app-manifest.schema.json`, `main.tf`,
`.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `.flightdeck-version`, `Makefile`) and bumps the
pinned module ref in the same step, from the same tag.

```
make upgrade            # latest published vX.Y.Z tag
make upgrade TAG=v0.4.0 # a specific tag — including downgrades, for recovery
```

**Dirty-tree rule**: `make upgrade` refuses to run if any platform-owned path
has uncommitted changes (tracked or untracked — this also catches stray files
an agent dropped under `docs/`). It never discards work; commit or stash
first, then re-run.

**Review, then commit yourself**: `make upgrade` never commits. It prints the
previous version, the new tag, and the exact file list it touched. Always
follow with `git diff && git status` to review before committing — treat it
like any dependency bump.

**Immutable provenance**: before replacing anything, the upgrade resolves the
requested tag to its commit, downloads the archive by that commit, checks the
complete platform file set and embedded release marker, and confirms the tag
still resolves to the same commit. Releases before v0.5.0 did not carry a
marker, so their immutable archives are accepted only after the complete legacy
file set passes validation. The upgrade then records the tag, commit, and
downloaded archive SHA-256 in `.flightdeck-provenance`. A failed provenance or
archive-integrity check leaves every file untouched.

**One-time bootstrap for apps created before v0.5.0** (no `upgrade` target
yet in their Makefile):

```
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rpuffe/flightdeck/v0.5.0/template-app/Makefile -o Makefile
git add Makefile && git commit -m "bootstrap v0.5.0 Makefile"
make upgrade

```

This pulls just enough of the new Makefile to gain the `upgrade` target, then
`make upgrade` takes over and replaces the rest of the platform-owned set
normally.

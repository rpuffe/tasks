# flightdeck app contract

A flightdeck app is a Dockerfile + `app-manifest.yaml`: the platform builds,
scans, deploys, and serves it as an HTTPS service. You never touch AWS,
Terraform, or DNS.

**Run `make preflight` before every push** — it mirrors CI's gates locally
(manifest validation, image build, container boot + healthcheck, Trivy scans).

**Never edit `main.tf` or `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.** Both are pinned
platform boilerplate; editing either takes the app off the platform.

**`make upgrade` refreshes every platform-owned file to the latest platform
release** (see `docs/pipeline.md`); never hand-edit platform files.

**The manifest is `app-manifest.yaml`**, validated against
`app-manifest.schema.json` — let `make preflight` catch field-level mistakes.

**Environments**: push to `main` deploys dev
(`https://<name>-dev.fd.robertpuffe.com`); tagging `v*` promotes that exact
image to prod (`https://<name>.fd.robertpuffe.com`) — no rebuild. Pull
requests only run credential-free checks (build, scans, fmt/validate); no
deploy happens on a PR.

**Optional `storage: s3`** in the manifest grants a private per-environment
bucket via the injected `STORAGE_BUCKET` env var. Your healthcheck must
never depend on it — see `docs/contract.md`. `storage: s3-retained` is the
production-data variant: versioned, survives stack teardown. Either value
also makes deploys stop-then-start (single-writer guarantee, brief deploy
downtime).

**Optional `alerts:`** in the manifest turns log-line failure signatures
(CloudWatch Logs filter patterns) into alarms that email the platform
operator — for failures a green healthcheck can hide, like a replication
error. See `docs/contract.md`.

**Optional `auth: cognito`** in the manifest grants a per-environment
Cognito user pool + hosted login via injected `COGNITO_*` env vars (plain
OIDC, no AWS SDK, no secrets). Your healthcheck must never require login —
see `docs/contract.md`.

**Optional `secrets:`** lists environment variable names whose values are
operator-managed SSM SecureStrings. Names only — never put values in the
manifest, repository, Terraform inputs, or command line. Local preflight does
not inject secrets, so integrations must disable cleanly and `/healthz` must
still pass. See `docs/contract.md`.

**Optional `email:`** in the manifest grants scoped SES permission to send as
one declared address, injected as `MAIL_FROM`/`MAIL_REGION`. Dev always sends
from the platform zone, never the production address. Needs the From domain
verified in SES *and* an operator-side grant — an app cannot enable its own
sending. Mail must disable cleanly when `MAIL_FROM` is unset. See
`docs/contract.md`.

## Docs — read the one for the task at hand, not all of them upfront

- `docs/contract.md` — runtime expectations: what your app must do, what the platform already does for you.
- `docs/dockerfile.md` — image rules and scan gates.
- `docs/pipeline.md` — what PRs, pushes to `main`, and `v*` tags each trigger, and a failure→fix playbook.
- `docs/example.md` — a worked example, built end-to-end.
